# Introduction

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is an ecological observation facility that collects data on rapidly changing ecological processes in the United States. NEON has standardized data from 81 field sites that span across the United States within 20 eco-climatic domains that represent regions of distinct land forms, vegetation, climate, and ecosystem dynamics. NEON measures the causes and effects of environmental change in different types of environments. 

The different types of field sites include core terrestrial sites, core aquatic sites, relocatable terrestrial sites, and relocatable aquatic sites. The different sites ensure that the data will statistically represent ecological, physical, and biological differences spanning the continent. As seen from the image below, the field sites are also in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. This image shows where the NEON sites are located including where the four different types of sites are located.

At the varying sites multiple different functional groups of dry mass are recorded depending the location of the site. This includes dry mass of flowers, leaves, mixed, needles, other, seeds, twigs/branches, and woody material. The sites that I will be focussing on for this analysis are the terrestrial sites. Specifically, I will be focusing on the dry mass of leaves at the terrestrial sites of Bartlett Experimental Forest (BART), Guanica Forest (GUAN), Harvard Forest (HARV), Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER), Steigerwaldt Land Services (STEI), Treehaven (TREE), and UNDERC (UNDE). I also chose to do a more in depth analysis of the GUAN dry mass of leaves, and look at what time of the year had the most and the least amount dry mass.  

Understanding this data is important because it can be used by scientists, researchers, professors, and students to gain knowledge about ecological differences between different environments on recent ongoing data collection.

# Methods

The data collected at the sites is called litterfall. This data of litter and leaves is collected from each site by field sampling techniques, and sensor-derived airborne remote methods at different scales. This includes collecting data from elevated areas, ground traps, and single collection events. Mass data was collected using different functional groups which includes, leaves, needles, twigs/branches, woody material, seeds, flowers, lichen/other, and mixed. This data is used to estimate annual Above ground Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) and biomass at the sites. Also, it can be used to understand vegetative carbon fluxes over time. We are analyzing this data using R to create a box plot, ANOVA test, and scatterplot to determine if there are significant differences of the dry mass of leaves at the varying sites.


Describe briefly where the data came from, including how they were collected in the field (information is in the pdf file in the data folder), and how you are analyzing them (e.g. using R to visualize the results and an ANOVA to test for significant differences).

# Results

```{r}
# read in litterfall data
litterfall_data <- read.csv("data/ltr_massdata.csv",
                            header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# subset litterfall data to only show leaves
Leaves <- subset(litterfall_data,
                 functionalGroup == "Leaves")
```

```{r}
# mass of litter by functional type
boxplot(dryMass ~ siteID,
        data = Leaves,
        main = "Mass of litterfall of Leaves",
        xlab = "SiteID's of Leaves Fallen",
        ylab = "Dry mass of litter in grams",
        las = 2)
```

```{r}
# test for significance between the groups
anova(lm(dryMass ~ siteID,
         data = Leaves))
```

A statistical test of an ANOVA was used to determine if there is a significant difference of leaves fallen between the seven sites used in the box plot. The null hypothesis for an ANOVA test is there is no significant difference between the dry mass value of leaves fallen at each site. When we visualize the numbers from the ANOVA test, we see that there is a significant difference and we reject the null hypothesis. The ANOVA test came up with a P vaule less than <0.05. (ANOVA p = 2.2e-16).

```{r}
# subset a certain target site for leaves
Guan_data <- subset(Leaves,
                    siteID == "GUAN")
```

```{r}
# make a scatterplot of leaves at "GUAN"
plot(x = as.POSIXct(Guan_data$collectDate),
     y = Guan_data$dryMass,
     main = "Dry mass of flowers fallen in Treehaven",
     xlab = "Collection Date",
     ylab = "Dry mass of Leaves in grams",
     pch = "*")
```


# Discussion

Discuss the results you found. In the context of what you know about the site/sites and the predominant types of vegatation in those locations. What do the results indicate about the flow of C and N from the autotrophic biota and into the soil in comparison to what occurs at other sites and over time?
